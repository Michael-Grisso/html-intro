    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat" target="_blank">wildcat</a>.  It averages about 46cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23-25cm (9-10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails.  Males are larger than females.  Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).</p>

    <h2>Senses</h2>
    <p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.  Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light.  The domestic cat has slit pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.  However, the domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited.  A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone.  However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.</p>
